.IP
Used in the default value of navigate\-regex.
.IP
[default: ]
.HP
\fB\-\-hyperlinks\fR
.IP
Render commit hashes, file names, and line numbers as hyperlinks.
.IP
Following the hyperlink spec for terminal emulators: https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda. By default, file names and line numbers link to the local file using a file URL, whereas commit hashes link to the commit in GitHub, if the remote repository is hosted by GitHub. See \fB\-\-hyperlinks\-file\-link\-format\fR for full control over the file URLs emitted. Hyperlinks are supported by several common terminal emulators. To make them work, you must use less version >= 581 with the \fB\-R\fR flag (or use \fB\-r\fR with older less versions, but this will break e.g. \fB\-\-navigate\fR). If you use tmux, then you will also need a patched fork of tmux (see https://github.com/dandavison/tmux).
.HP
\fB\-\-hyperlinks\-commit\-link\-format\fR <FMT>
.IP
Format string for commit hyperlinks (requiraes \fB\-\-hyperlinks\fR).
.IP
The placeholder "{commit}" will be replaced by the commit hash. For example: \fB\-\-hyperlinks\-commit\-link\-format=\fR'https://mygitrepo/{commit}/'
.HP
\fB\-\-hyperlinks\-file\-link\-format\fR <FMT>
.IP
Format string for file hyperlinks (requires \fB\-\-hyperlinks\fR).
.IP
The placeholders "{path}" and "{line}" will be replaced by the absolute file path and the line number, respectively. The default value of this option creates hyperlinks using standard file URLs; your operating system should open these in the application registered for that file type. However, these do not make use of the line number. In order for the link to open the file at the correct line number, you could use a custom URL format such as "file\-line://{path}:{line}" and register an application to handle the custom "file\-line" URL scheme by opening the file in your editor/IDE at the indicated line number. See https://github.com/dandavison/open\-in\-editor for an example.
.IP
[default: file://{path}]
.HP
\fB\-\-inline\-hint\-style\fR <STYLE>
.IP
Style string for short inline hint text.

This styles certain content added by delta to the original diff such as special characters to highlight tabs, and the symbols used to indicate wrapped lines. See STYLES section.
.IP
[default: blue]
.HP
\fB\-\-inspect\-raw\-lines\fR <true|false>
.IP
Kill\-switch for \fB\-\-color\-moved\fR support.
.IP
Whether to examine ANSI color escape sequences in raw lines received from Git and handle lines colored in certain ways specially. This is on by default: it is how Delta supports Git's \fB\-\-color\-moved\fR feature. Set this to "false" to disable this behavior.
.IP
[default: true]
.HP
\fB\-\-keep\-plus\-minus\-markers\fR
.IP
Prefix added/removed lines with a +/\- character, as git does.
.IP
By default, delta does not emit any prefix, so code can be copied directly from delta's output.
.HP
\fB\-\-light\fR
.IP
Use default colors appropriate for a light terminal background.
.IP
For more control, see the style options and \fB\-\-syntax\-theme\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-line\-buffer\-size\fR <N>
.IP
Size of internal line buffer.
.IP
Delta compares the added and removed versions of nearby lines in order to detect and highlight changes at the level of individual words/tokens. Therefore, nearby lines must be buffered internally before they are painted and emitted. Increasing this value might improve highlighting of some large diff hunks. However, setting this to a high value will adversely affect delta's performance when entire files are added/removed.
.IP
[default: 32]
.HP
\fB\-\-line\-fill\-method\fR <STRING>
.IP
Line\-fill method in side\-by\-side mode.
.IP

.IP
[default: 0.6]
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-line\-length\fR <N>
.IP
Truncate lines longer than this.
.IP
To prevent any truncation, set to zero. Note that delta will be slow on very long lines (e.g. minified .js) if truncation is disabled. When wrapping lines it is automatically set to fit at least all visible characters.

In addition to named colors, arbitrary colors can be specified using RGB hex codes. See COLORS section.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\-config\fR
.IP
Display the active values for all Delta options.
.IP
Style string options are displayed with foreground and background colors. This can be used to experiment with colors by combining this option with other options such as \fB\-\-minus\-style\fR, \fB\-\-zero\-style\fR, \fB\-\-plus\-style\fR, \fB\-\-light\fR, \fB\-\-dark\fR, etc.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\-syntax\-themes\fR
.IP
Show example diff for available syntax\-highlighting themes.
.IP
If diff output is supplied on standard input then this will be used for the demo. For example: `git show | delta \fB\-\-show\-syntax\-themes\fR`.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\-themes\fR
.IP
Show example diff for available delta themes.
.IP
A delta theme is a delta named feature (see \fB\-\-features\fR) that sets either `light` or `dark`. See https://github.com/dandavison/delta#custom\-color\-themes. If diff output is supplied on standard input then this will be used for the demo. For example: `git show | delta \fB\-\-show\-themes\fR`. By default shows dark or light themes only, according to whether delta is in dark or light mode (as set by the user or inferred from BAT_THEME). To control the themes shown, use \fB\-\-dark\fR or \fB\-\-light\fR, or both, on the command line together with this option.
.HP

.IP
Display diffs in side\-by\-side layout
.HP
\fB\-\-syntax\-theme\fR <SYNTAX_THEME>
.IP
The syntax\-highlighting theme to use.
.IP
Use \fB\-\-show\-syntax\-themes\fR to demo available themes. Defaults to the value of the BAT_THEME environment variable, if that contains a valid theme name. \fB\-\-syntax\-theme\fR=\fI\,none\/\fR disables all syntax highlighting.
.HP
\fB\-\-tabs\fR <N>
.IP
The number of spaces to replace tab characters with.
.IP
Use \fB\-\-tabs\fR=\fI\,0\/\fR to pass tab characters through directly, but note that in that case delta will calculate line widths assuming tabs occupy one character's width on the screen: if your terminal renders tabs as more than than one character wide then delta's output will look incorrect.
.IP
[default: 4]
.HP
\fB\-\-true\-color\fR <auto|always|never>
.IP
Whether to emit 24\-bit ("true color") RGB color codes.
.IP
Options are auto, always, and never. "auto" means that delta will emit 24\-bit color codes if the environment variable COLORTERM has the value "truecolor" or "24bit". If your terminal application (the application you use to enter commands at a shell prompt) supports 24 bit colors, then it probably already sets this environment variable, in which case you don't need to do anything.
.IP
[default: auto]
.HP
\fB\-\-whitespace\-error\-style\fR <STYLE>
.IP
Style string for whitespace errors.
.IP
Defaults to color.diff.whitespace if that is set in git config, or else 'magenta reverse'.
.IP
[default: "auto auto"]
.HP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-width\fR <N>
.IP
The width of underline/overline decorations.
.IP
Examples: "72" (exactly 72 characters), "\-2" (auto\-detected terminal width minus 2). An expression such as "74\-2" is also valid (equivalent to 72 but may be useful if the caller has a variable holding the value "74"). Use \fB\-\-width\fR=\fI\,variable\/\fR to extend decorations and background colors to the end of the text only. Otherwise background colors extend to the full terminal width.
.HP
\fB\-\-word\-diff\-regex\fR <REGEX>
.IP
Regular expression defining a 'word' in within\-line diff algorithm.
.IP
The regular expression used to decide what a word is for the within\-line highlight algorithm. For less fine\-grained matching than the default try \fB\-\-word\-diff\-regex=\fR"\eS+" \fB\-\-max\-line\-distance\fR=\fI\,1\/\fR.0 (this is more similar to `git \fB\-\-word\-diff\fR`).
.IP
[default: \ew+]
.HP
\fB\-\-wrap\-left\-symbol\fR <STRING>
.IP
End\-of\-line wrapped content symbol (left\-aligned).
.IP
Symbol added to the end of a line indicating that the content has been wrapped onto the next line and continues left\-aligned.
.IP
[default: ↵]
.HP
\fB\-\-wrap\-max\-lines\fR <N>
.IP
How often a line should be wrapped if it does not fit.
.IP
Zero means to never wrap. Any content which does not fit will be truncated. A value of "unlimited" means a line will be wrapped as many times as required.
.IP
[default: 2]
.HP
\fB\-\-wrap\-right\-percent\fR <PERCENT>
.IP
Threshold for right\-aligning wrapped content.
.IP
If the length of the remaining wrapped content, as a percentage of width, is less than this quantity it will be right\-aligned. Otherwise it will be left\-aligned.

[default: 37.0]
.HP
\fB\-\-wrap\-right\-prefix\-symbol\fR <STRING>
.IP
Pre\-wrapped content symbol (right\-aligned).
.IP
Symbol displayed before right\-aligned wrapped content.

.SS "GIT CONFIG:"
.IP
⠀
.PP
By default, delta takes settings from a section named "delta" in git config files, if one is
present. The git config file to use for delta options will usually be ~/.gitconfig, but delta
follows the rules given in https://git\-scm.com/docs/git\-config#FILES. Most delta options can be
given in a git config file, using the usual option names but without the initial '\-\-'. An example
is
.PP
[delta]
.IP
line\-numbers = true
zero\-style = dim syntax
.SS "FEATURES:"
.IP
⠀
.PP
A feature is a named collection of delta options in git config. An example is:
.PP
[delta "my\-delta\-feature"]
.IP
syntax\-theme = Dracula
plus\-style = bold syntax "#002800"
.PP
To activate those options, you would use:
.PP
delta \fB\-\-features\fR my\-delta\-feature
.PP
A feature name may not contain whitespace. You can activate multiple features:
.PP
[delta]
.IP
features = my\-highlight\-styles\-colors\-feature my\-line\-number\-styles\-feature
.PP
If more than one feature sets the same option, the last one wins.
.SS "STYLES:"
.IP
⠀
.PP
All options that have a name like \fB\-\-\fR*\-style work the same way. It is very similar to how
colors/styles are specified in a gitconfig file:
https://git\-scm.com/docs/git\-config#Documentation/git\-config.txt\-color
.PP
Here is an example:
.PP
\fB\-\-minus\-style\fR 'red bold ul "#ffeeee"'
.PP
That means: For removed lines, set the foreground (text) color to 'red', make it bold and
.IP
underlined, and set the background color to '#ffeeee'.
.PP
See the COLORS section below for how to specify a color. In addition to real colors, there are 4
special color names: 'auto', 'normal', 'raw', and 'syntax'.
.PP
Here is an example of using special color names together with a single attribute:
.PP
\fB\-\-minus\-style\fR 'syntax bold auto'
.PP
That means: For removed lines, syntax\-highlight the text, and make it bold, and do whatever delta
.IP
normally does for the background.
.PP
The available attributes are: 'blink', 'bold', 'dim', 'hidden', 'italic', 'reverse', 'strike',
and 'ul' (or 'underline').
.PP
The attribute 'omit' is supported by commit\-style, file\-style, and hunk\-header\-style, meaning to
remove the element entirely from the output.
.PP
A complete description of the style string syntax follows:
.PP
\- If the input that delta is receiving already has colors, and you want delta to output those
.IP
colors unchanged, then use the special style string 'raw'. Otherwise, delta will strip any colors
from its input.
.PP
\- A style string consists of 0, 1, or 2 colors, together with an arbitrary number of style
.IP
attributes, all separated by spaces.
.PP
\- The first color is the foreground (text) color. The second color is the background color.
.IP
Attributes can go in any position.
.PP
\- This means that in order to specify a background color you must also specify a foreground (text)
.IP
color.
.PP
\- If you want delta to choose one of the colors automatically, then use the special color 'auto'.
.IP
This can be used for both foreground and background.
.PP
\- If you want the foreground/background color to be your terminal's foreground/background color,
.IP
then use the special color 'normal'.
.PP
\- If you want the foreground text to be syntax\-highlighted according to its language, then use the
.IP
special foreground color 'syntax'. This can only be used for the foreground (text).
.PP
\- The minimal style specification is the empty string ''. This means: do not apply any colors or
.IP
styling to the element in question.
.SS "COLORS:"
.IP
⠀
.PP
There are four ways to specify a color (this section applies to foreground and background colors
within a style string):
.PP
1. CSS color name
.IP
Any of the 140 color names used in CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp
.PP
2. RGB hex code
.IP
An example of using an RGB hex code is:
\fB\-\-file\-style=\fR"#0e7c0e"
.PP
3. ANSI color name
.IP
There are 8 ANSI color names:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white.
.IP
In addition, all of them have a bright form:
brightblack, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, brightwhite.
.IP
An example of using an ANSI color name is:
\fB\-\-file\-style=\fR"green"
.IP
Unlike RGB hex codes, ANSI color names are just names: you can choose the exact color that each
name corresponds to in the settings of your terminal application (the application you use to
enter commands at a shell prompt). This means that if you use ANSI color names, and you change
the color theme used by your terminal, then delta's colors will respond automatically, without
needing to change the delta command line.
.IP
"purple" is accepted as a synonym for "magenta". Color names and codes are case\-insensitive.
.PP
4. ANSI color number
.IP
An example of using an ANSI color number is:
\fB\-\-file\-style\fR=\fI\,28\/\fR
.IP
There are 256 ANSI color numbers: 0\-255. The first 16 are the same as the colors described in
the "ANSI color name" section above. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8\-bit.
Specifying colors like this is useful if your terminal only supports 256 colors (i.e. doesn't
support 24\-bit color).
.SS "LINE NUMBERS:"
.IP
⠀
.PP
To display line numbers, use \fB\-\-line\-numbers\fR.
.PP
Line numbers are displayed in two columns. Here's what it looks like by default:
.TP
1 ⋮
1 │ unchanged line
.TP
2 ⋮
│ removed line
.TP
⋮
2 │ added line
.PP
In that output, the line numbers for the old (minus) version of the file appear in the left column,
and the line numbers for the new (plus) version of the file appear in the right column. In an
unchanged (zero) line, both columns contain a line number.
.PP
The following options allow the line number display to be customized:
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-left\-format\fR:
Change the contents of the left column
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-right\-format\fR:
Change the contents of the right column
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-left\-style\fR:
Change the style applied to the left column
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-right\-style\fR:
Change the style applied to the right column
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-minus\-style\fR:
Change the style applied to line numbers in minus lines
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-zero\-style\fR:
Change the style applied to line numbers in unchanged lines
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\-plus\-style\fR:
Change the style applied to line numbers in plus lines
.PP
Options \fB\-\-line\-numbers\-left\-format\fR and \fB\-\-line\-numbers\-right\-format\fR allow you to change the contents
of the line number columns. Their values are arbitrary format strings, which are allowed to contain
the placeholders {nm} for the line number associated with the old version of the file and {np} for
the line number associated with the new version of the file. The placeholders support a subset of
the string formatting syntax documented here: https://doc.rust\-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting\-parameters.
Specifically, you can use the alignment and width syntax.
.PP
For example, the default value of \fB\-\-line\-numbers\-left\-format\fR is '{nm:^4}⋮'. This means that the
left column should display the minus line number (nm), center\-aligned, padded with spaces to a
width of 4 characters, followed by a unicode dividing\-line character (⋮).
.PP
Similarly, the default value of \fB\-\-line\-numbers\-right\-format\fR is '{np:^4}│'. This means that the
right column should display the plus line number (np), center\-aligned, padded with spaces to a
width of 4 characters, followed by a unicode dividing\-line character (│).
.PP
Use '<' for left\-align, '^' for center\-align, and '>' for right\-align.
